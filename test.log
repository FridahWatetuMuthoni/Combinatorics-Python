Description: This i a sample of a log file

Okay, so this is a sample entry.
Im going to write a few more lines that makes no sence
Now lets look at a function that will allow us to get a slice of an iterator
It basically like list slicing but in this case it performs slicing on an iterator

What you will notice is that permutations and combinations dont repeat values.
For example it doesnt give us something like aa or bb as one of the permutations
To allow repeats, for example if we wanted to see all the different ways that we can create a 4 digit passcode
we would not use combiations and permutations. for that we could use the product function
The product function will give you the cartesian product of iterables that you pass in. If  you only pass in one iterable then
we can tell it how many times we want it to be able to repeat those values
